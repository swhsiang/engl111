# Report

In this theme, I would like to reflect on collaboration topic based on my Vlog #8 project #2 reflection and journal #6 from ENGL 110.

Being able to work with others is a vital skill to succeed in the modern society. Nowadays, the problems we are facing are complex to solve by single person. It's important for us to learn collaboration in school before we go to work in industries.

# Relate
In our project 2, we first had a hard time to determine the topic of the project, and then had some problems figurint out when to start working on the project. I was not happy with the way we collaborated. Some people refused to have in-person meeting and believed we could exchange ideas via GroupMe message app. Some members did express their opinions or did not prepare for group discussion. I procrastinated to record my presentation until last minute. Though the outcome seems OK but the expereience was not fun at all.


# Reason
Full-time students usually have heavy workloads. Students may prioritize their own tasks and that's the moment where the conflict of interest among the group happened.

Another possible reason is the difference of cultural values. Everyone comes with different backgrounds and may prefer different ways to complete one thing.


# Reconstruct
In an ideal case, inviting everyone in the group to exchange their expectations to the project and each other. Once the group finds the concensus. In addition to that, someone in the group must stand out to be the one who reminds everyone when to do what. By doing that, everyone would stay on the right track and complete the project on time.
