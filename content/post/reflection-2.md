# Report

For this theme, I select journal #2 and #8. My journal #8 is based on a book, Funny in Farsi, a story about the life of an Iranian girl. The book shows how the author has been suffering from the stereotypes of Iranian. The journal #2 is about a study of the effect of accents, published by NAU.

# Relate

As an international student, it is easy for me to understand from what she suffered, though I have not experienced serious discrimination in the US. It's natural but incorrect that people interact with others based on stereotypes


I am a pessimistic person and I believe that the longer we stay in the US, the higher the chance that we will encounter some kind of discrimination against us.


Here in the US, discrimination is a big issue. A small part of population may hurt others because of discrimination. We called it Hate Crime. That's really scary because of its randomness. 

# Reason
It takes time to build trust between two strangers. When we first meet someone, we don't know much about each other. Oftentimes, we let stereotypes lead us to develop relationship.

# Reconstruct

Modern society is so complicated. There is no single rule or simple guidelines for us to follow. We all should try our best to be open-minded and get along with people with different backgrounds.
