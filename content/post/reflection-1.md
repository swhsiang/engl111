# Report
Here I would reflect on vlog #1 and vlog #5. One is about the voice of immigrants and the uniqueness of being an immigrant.

# Relate
Finding the sense of belonging is important but difficult. There are two moments in my life when I found out my self-identity changed. The first time was 6 years ago. A 
civic movement happened in Taiwan and that changed my view of China. In Taiwan, we had a huge portion of population who were pro-China and believed that Taiwan should maintain good relationship with China, even if we have to sacrifice our independence. That movement changed my values and I stop viewing myself a Chinese even though my ancestors were from China. Now, I view myself a Taiwanese because I know my values differ from Chinese people's values.

The second moment happened a year ago. I found an internship and enjoyed working at a high-tech company. At that moment,  all the struggles of studying at Purdue paid off. I started believeing American's Dream is true and decided I want to become US citizen if I can. It is a land of opportunities.
 

# Reason
It's critical to us to find out or create the sense of belonging. Oftentimes, the education system and the surrounding people influence us.

# Reconstruct
Blood or skin color determine the starting point of our life but they do not determine who we want to be and where we want to go. It's what we experienced shape our values and push us to where we belong.
