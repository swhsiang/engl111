Welcome to my e-portfolio. I am Wen-Hsiang. I wrote three reflections related to what I have learned from ENGL 110 / 111 class.

I selected three themes, Indentity, Cultural Values, and Stereotype & Generalization.

In ENGL class, I learned the history of immigrants in the US, some existing challenges in the US society, and American's values.
