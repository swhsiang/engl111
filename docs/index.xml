      <description>Report In this theme, I would like to reflect on collaboration topic based on my Vlog #8 and project #2 reflection.
Being able to work with others is a vital skill to succeed in the modern society. Nowadays, the problems we are facing are complex to solve by single person. It&amp;rsquo;s important for us to learn collaboration in school before we go to work in industries.
Relate In our project 2, we first had a hard time to determine the topic of the project, and then had some problems figurint out when to start working on the project.</description>

      <description>Report For this theme, I select journal #8. My journal #8 is based on a book, Funny in Farsi, a story about the life of an Iranian girl. The book shows how the author has been suffering from the stereotypes of Iranian.
Relate As an international student, it is easy for me to understand from what she suffered, though I have not experienced serious discrimination in the US. It&amp;rsquo;s natural but incorrect that people interact with others based on stereotypes.</description>
